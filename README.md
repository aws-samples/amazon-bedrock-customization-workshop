# Bedrock Model Customization Workshop Notebooks

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the [Bedrock Model Customization Workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). This repository contains the notebooks that you will use to participate in hands-on activities designed to deepen your understanding of model customization with Amazon Bedrock.

### What is Amazon Bedrock?

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that simplifies accessing and customizing foundation models (FMs) from both third-party providers and Amazon, made accessible through a streamlined API. Customizing these models involves providing training data to enhance their performance for specific applications, thereby improving overall customer experience.

### Customization Techniques Offered:

#### Continued Pre-training
This method involves feeding unlabeled data to a foundation model, thereby helping it to better understand specific types of inputs and improve its domain knowledge. By continuously updating the model with new data—such as private business documents that aren't publicly available—its performance is progressively enhanced.

#### Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is performed by providing a model with labeled data, which allows it to learn the associations between various inputs and desired outputs. This targeted training helps improve the model’s ability to perform specific tasks effectively.

### Workshop Overview

During this workshop, you will:
- Learn about common patterns for creating custom models using Amazon Bedrock.
- Gain practical experience by navigating the AWS console, utilizing SDKs within Jupyter Notebooks.
- Conduct model customization training jobs.
- Manage provisioned throughputs for model hosting.
- Deploy and interact with custom models in a real-world setting.

This workshop is designed for developers and solution builders looking to expand their expertise in machine learning model customization.
